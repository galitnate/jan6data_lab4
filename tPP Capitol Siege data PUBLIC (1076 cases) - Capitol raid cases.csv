Throughout the trip, Marquez, 25, shot a series of clips on Snapchat while driving his Tesla and vaping. A longtime ride-share driver, Marquez said he went to D.C. to protest the “normalization of prostitution” and Communism.

He felt dismayed by the way Trump was treated in office. “I feel Trump was done like Richard Nixon but to a greater scale.” In D.C., Marquez uploaded clips of himself participating in outdoor rallies. Before entering the Capitol Building, Marquez uploaded a clip showing people scaling a wall on the building, according to his criminal complaint.

Two days after the riot and before boarding his flight back to Houston, Alvarado on Jan. 8 described his experience in a Zoom interview with a Fox26 Houston reporter. He said he went to the Capitol to protest because he believed the election was fraudulent, according to the interview, but that he did not enter the building. The police presence was ""almost non-existent,"" Alvarado told Fox26, describing how he walked onto the Capitol grounds after people moved barriers aside. ""I turned around trying to get out and it was really impossible because people kept pushing me in,"" he told the reporter. ""I found myself really close to the cops. I was with my hands up and I told them, 'I’m not part of this. I’m trying to get out.'""

Agents then conducted an in-person interview with a local Sewell farmer who purchased produce from Stecher who said they’d known him for over 10 years. An agent showed the person still images from the video and the person identified Stecher as the man they know as “Zeke,” the FBI says in the complaint.

Prosecutors say that he was already on the radar of law enforcement after a rioter who pleaded guilty identified him as one of the people who lined up with the Oath Keepers the day of the riot. The criminal complaint alleges that he was part of the group that entered into a formation — called a “stack” — in order to force its way into the Capitol. Court documents enumerate many records obtained that show Beeks traveled to Washington, D.C., on the day of the riot, including records from a personal finance app and a rental car agency, as well as cellphone records. Beeks was not wearing the typical camouflage favored by the far-right extremist group, according to court documents, but instead appears in images from that day in a black jacket with the word “Bad” on it in red letters, from Michael Jackson's 1987 world tour. It is that jacket that helped lead law enforcement to him; agents found photographs on Instagram of a person who appears to be Beeks wearing the jacket while posing in front of a sign for the musical play Jesus Christ Superstar. Beeks is an actor who performs as Judas — under the stage name James T. Justis — in the traveling production of the play, and the criminal complaint notes he was observed performing the role in both San Francisco and Los Angeles. In addition, he has also performed as a Michael Jackson impersonator. Prosecutors claim that Beeks changed his phone and phone number the day after an indictment naming co-conspirators was filed and registered his new phone under his stage name. After Beeks was charged, he appeared in court and claimed that the U.S. government had no authority over him — which a U.S. District judge called “gobbledygook.” The production of Jesus Christ Superstar has since replaced him in the role of Judas.

Johnson was arrested pursuant to a complaint in the District of Columbia and made his initial appearance in court on April 14. The complaint charges Johnson with inflicting bodily injury on certain officers; obstruction of law enforcement during civil disorder; obstruction of justice and Congress; engaging in physical violence in a restricted building or grounds; and acts of physical violence in the Capitol grounds or buildings. According to court documents, Johnson was at the Capitol on Jan. 6 where he was captured on video assaulting a U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) officer and engaging in disorderly conduct. As depicted in open-source video footage reviewed by the FBI, Johnson was part of a crowd of people seen walking over and around the first line of barricades just off the roadway of Peace Circle. As the crowd approached a second line of barricades, guarded by uniformed USCP officers, Johnson can be seen on video holding a megaphone and shouting profanities toward the police, including, “Let’s go! F*** this s***! We pay your bills, you back the f*** off.” As alleged, Johnson became confrontational with USCP officers as he approached the second line of barricades. He can be seen forcibly pushing and pulling on the metal barricades which caused a USCP officer to fall and hit her head on the stairs before losing consciousness. Hours later, the officer blacked out and collapsed while arresting a rioter and had to be transported to the emergency room where she was assessed to have suffered a concussion. After dismantling and knocking over the line of metal barricades, Johnson can be seen running up the steps and further onto restricted grounds. Later in the evening of Jan. 6, a YouTube user posted a video in which Johnson recounted the events that took place outside the Capitol earlier that day. Throughout the video, Johnson described how he personally broke through the barricades, stating, “There’s three sets of gates before you get to the stairs of the Capitol. Alright? We get to the next gate. There’s probably . . . there’s a s*** load of cops up there then. Second wing, we breached, pulled up, start throwing s***. I mean we’re fu-, we’re fighting cops and s***.

For weeks prior, Boughner wrote multiple social media entries questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election and calling Joe Biden “stupid,” according to court records. Boughner first came to the attention of the FBI in the spring of 2021 when FBI agents reviewed police body-worn camera footage that allegedly shows Boughner assaulting an officer with a chemical spray. Subsequently, the FBI issued a BOLO alert for the then-unidentified Boughner. In addition, the volunteer group Sedition Hunters assigned a moniker to the person who federal prosecutors say is Boughner: “#blackpufferwhitescarf."" According to the FBI, Boughner was identified by a tattoo of a five-point star below a dragon on the inside of his left wrist.

The subscriber data provided by Facebook allegedly confirmed he was indeed at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

A Twitter profile with the name “Mathew Capsel” clearly indicates that “Mateo Q” is a reference to QAnon.","Charging Documents, News article","Jan6 Capitol, QAnon"

On Jan. 6, Cruz watched Trump’s speech and then marched with the crowd to the U.S. Capitol, court documents indicate. He allegedly told the FBI, who interviewed him several months later, that he observed Capitol personnel remove the lower barriers so that people could walk closer to the building. He also allegedly told agents that he saw people dressed in “dark clothing,” who he assumed were antifa, pushing and removing barriers on the upper level of the Capitol. (There is no evidence that antifa played any major role in the attack on the Capitol.) Cruz told investigators that he then went to get food from a food truck and saw gas and rubber bullets being deployed on people at the upper barriers. According to court documents, Cruz's further stated that he went back onto the Capitol grounds to help anyone who might be injured, but did not enter the building. In June, the FBI interviewed Cruz voluntarily again. He allegedly stated that he recorded footage on his GoPro camera and gave the content to the FBI. The contents of the camera, in addition to security camera footage, allegedly show Cruz inside the building. The FBI interviewed Cruz three additional times and during the final interview he did confirm he was inside the building, court documents indicate. (NPR)",Charging Documents,Jan6 Capitol

The criminal complaint references an article from *Insider,* published the day after the riot, that says Franklin tripped while at the bottom of the Capitol steps and fell onto an officer who he says “barely reacted.” The article reported that Franklin followed a group of people who were climbing scaffolding and entering the building through a window that was smashed. Once inside, Franklin allegedly followed people onto the floor of the Senate and observed “a shirtless man with an animal skin headdress and his face painted red, white, and blue stood at the speaker's chair, wielding a bullhorn, and flexing his biceps” who was presumably Jacob Chansley, also known as the QAnon Shaman. Months after the riot, agents say they tracked Franklin down at his house, executed a search warrant and seized gear that they claim can be seen in images of that day and in particular the footage from the Senate floor: a Trump 2020 Keep America Great flag, a plaid patterned shirt, a pair of Nike shoes and a baseball cap emblazoned with “United States of America” and a flag in the center. During the execution of the search warrant, an FBI agent alleges that he overheard a conversation between Franklin and his significant other. In the conversation, Franklin allegedly admitted that he was in the Capitol building. He also allegedly said, “You had to be there, the whole thing was fun.” (NPR)",Charging Documents,Jan6 Capitol

Wilson was a county-level leader of the Oath Keepers based in North Carolina, and he conspired with other members of the group to ""oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power,"" according to a statement of offense Wilson signed and submitted in federal court as part of his guilty plea. In the days and weeks after the November 2020 presidential election, Wilson exchanged messages with other members of the Oath Keepers about how they believed Joe Biden had stolen the election and, as Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes allegedly put it in one message, ""we aren't getting through this without a civil war."" On Jan. 5, 2021, Wilson drove from North Carolina to a hotel in Vienna, Va., which is near Washington, D.C., and brought with him an ""AR-15-style rifle, a 9-millimeter pistol, approximately 200 rounds of ammunition, body armor, a camouflaged combat uniform, pepper spray, a large walking stick intended for use as a weapon, and a pocketknife,"" court documents state.

""in case of worst case scenarios,"" as Rhodes reportedly wrote in one message. On the day of the riot, Wilson breached the Capitol and helped force open doors to the building's rotunda, according to court documents. Prosecutors allege that at least 14 Oath Keepers breached the Capitol. Wilson left the building and later that evening gathered with Rhodes and other Oath Keepers at the Phoenix Park Hotel in Washington, D.C. At one point, court documents state, Rhodes called an unidentified person via speakerphone and ""repeatedly implore[d] the individual to tell President Trump to call upon groups like the Oath Keepers to forcibly oppose the transfer of power."" The person ""denied Rhodes's request to speak directly with President Trump,"" according to court documents, which do not state what relationship that person may have had to Trump. Afterward, members of the group reportedly had dinner at an Olive Garden restaurant and discussed the possibility of taking further actions to fight the transfer of power.

A few seconds later, prosecutors say, the video shows Ramey spraying a second officer...During the investigation of Ramey, FBI agents in Miami allegedly learned from multiple confidential sources that Ramey was included on a master list of Proud Boys members in Southern Florida. They also determined a cellphone associated with his number had been at the U.S. Capitol Building on Jan. 6. In February, an FBI agent left his business card with an associate of Ramey’s while attempting to interview him. A day later, the agent received a call from Ramey’s attorney, who said his client had learned the agent wanted to interview him. Then, earlier this month, according to court documents, the agent received a call on his work cell phone from a person he believed to be Ramey who asked if it was him and, cryptically, “And you still live at [your affiant’s home address]?” When the agent asked who was calling, Ramey reportedly hung up immediately. A short time later, the agent said, he received a text message from the same number which included the VIN for a vehicle he’d previously owned. The agent then received a follow-up text reading, “Check that VIN number. ;).”"" (WUSA)","Charging Documents, News article",Jan6 Capitol
